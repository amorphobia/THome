# THome
THome is a static minimal personal dashboard made for local use, except its a bit easier to maintain and update it using python

I just wanted to make my own dashboard for my homelab and used the things i know to put it together as simple as i can

# Features
- simple design
- responsive, works great on PC, tablet and phone
- doesn't require any special dependencies, for linux at least
- has search to filter your cards
- works fast and perfectly without internet, since all the css and js are attached
